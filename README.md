## Text Extraction using OCR and Pytesseract: Automating Credit Card Information Extraction from Images


The "Text Extraction using OCR and Pytesseract" project aims to automate the process of extracting credit card information from images. By leveraging the power of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Pytesseract, this project enables efficient and accurate extraction of crucial details, including the credit card number, expiration date, and cardholder name, from credit card images.

Using this project, you can streamline the otherwise time-consuming task of manually transcribing credit card information. The code utilizes Pytesseract, a popular OCR library, and OpenCV, a computer vision library, to achieve the desired text extraction.

The project begins by importing the necessary libraries and configuring Pytesseract to use the Tesseract OCR engine. The credit card image is loaded using OpenCV, and preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance the image quality and readability.

The core of the project lies in the OCR process. Pytesseract's "image_to_data" function is employed to extract text from the image. The extracted data is then processed and analyzed to identify the relevant credit card information.

Through a systematic approach, the code iterates over the extracted results, excluding the header information. Each line of text is parsed and evaluated to determine if it contains credit card details. Once identified, the relevant information is extracted and visually highlighted on the image using bounding boxes and text overlays.

By running this code, the credit card image is displayed, with the extracted text accurately highlighted for easy identification. This project serves as a valuable tool for applications such as credit card data digitization, automated form filling, and data entry automation, saving significant time and effort.
